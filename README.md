### Imporvements, security & other vulnerability fixes

- 1.  React (`18.3.1` from `17.0.2`)

  - Concurrent Features: Introduces concurrent rendering and Suspense for data fetching, which could break old code not designed for it【15†source】.
  - Strict Mode Changes: Components unmount and remount in development, which could lead to unexpected behavior if side effects are not managed【15†source】.

  2.  Axios (`1.7.7` from `0.21.1`)

  - Prototype Pollution Vulnerability: Fixed vulnerabilities like prototype pollution, SSRF (Server-Side Request Forgery), and others that could be exploited【14†source】.
  - CORS and CSRF Fixes: Enhanced security to prevent Cross-Origin and Cross-Site Request Forgery attacks【14†source】【15†source】.

  3.  @mui/material (`5.16.7` from `4.12.3`)

  - Emotion Styling Issues: Switching to Emotion for styling led to breaking changes in handling styles, impacting existing apps using older Material-UI versions【14†source】.
  - Security Updates: MUI has patched several security vulnerabilities in dependencies like Emotion【14†source】.

  4.  React Router DOM (`6.14.0` from `5.2.0`)

  - Breaking API Changes: Major changes in the routing API require extensive refactoring. Old hooks and route matching patterns have been deprecated【15†source】.

  5.  @emotion/react (`11.13.3` from `11.11.0`)

  - Build Problems in Webpack: Some issues related to dynamic dependency imports caused problems with bundling, particularly in Next.js and Webpack builds【14†source】.

  6.  @mui/lab (`5.0.0-alpha.120` from `4.0.0-alpha.60`)

  - Breaking Changes in Components: Several alpha-level components have breaking changes and are still in experimental stages【14†source】.

  7.  @testing-library/react (`14.0.0` from `11.2.7`)

  - API Changes: Updated testing utilities to better align with React 18's concurrent features, which can break existing tests relying on synchronous behavior【14†source】.

  8.  Tailwind CSS (`3.3.2` from `2.2.4`)

  - Vulnerabilities Patched: Earlier versions of Tailwind had issues with vulnerabilities in dependencies like postcss. These have been addressed in version 3.x【14†source】.

  9.  @mui/styled-engine-sc (`6.1.0`)

  - CSS-in-JS Compatibility: Issues with `styled-components` compatibility with the latest versions of MUI. It can lead to style collisions or degraded performance【14†source】.

  10. web-vitals (`2.1.4` from `1.1.2`)

  - Performance Fixes: Improved metrics collection for Core Web Vitals, with better handling of long tasks and rendering bottlenecks【14†source】.

These updates contain important security patches and feature enhancements, but many introduce breaking changes requiring careful migration.
